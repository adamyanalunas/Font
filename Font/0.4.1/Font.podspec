  Custom fonts are great. Swift is pretty great. But UIFont is still stringly-typed. And then there's dealing with Dynamic Type.

  Font allows you to deal with fonts in a strongly-typed manner with no pain when it comes to Dynamic Type.

  * Register your custom font and its sizes
  * Implement it
  * Register something to update the font size when the Dynamic Font size changes
  * Keep being awesome
